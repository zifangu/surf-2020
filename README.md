# Supervised Learning on League of Legends

League of Legends is an online multiplayer video game. Each game consist of two teams competing against each other. Only two outcomes are possible: Blue Team wins or Red Team wins, making this a classification problem. Find out more about the game on their [official website](http://leagueoflegends.com).

This repository contains some machine learning methods I implemented to predict the outcome, including kmeans, naive bayes, stepwise regression, and decision trees.

The graphs directory gives more information about the AUC for their corresponding titled methods, in addition to a pruned tree.
